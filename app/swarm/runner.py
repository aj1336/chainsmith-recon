"""
app/swarm/runner.py - SwarmRunner: drop-in replacement for CheckLauncher.

When swarm mode is enabled, run_scan() uses SwarmRunner instead of
CheckLauncher. SwarmRunner does not execute checks itself -- it waits
for remote agents to complete tasks via the coordinator.

KNOWN GAP (tracked follow-up): unlike CheckLauncher, the swarm path does NOT
enforce per-check `on_critical` (stop / skip_downstream) — see Phase 56.15. A
critical observation from a swarm task neither halts the scan nor skips its DAG
dependents. Enforcing it here means a post-completion hook in the coordinator
(inspect each result's severity, halt via `is_running=False` or gate task
assignment on the dependents set). Deferred to keep 56.15 scoped to the local
launcher.
