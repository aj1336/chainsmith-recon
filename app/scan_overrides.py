"""app/scan_overrides.py - Per-check scan-time overrides (§5.1 **layer 6b**, 56.17).

The runtime *scalpel*: explicit per-check tunable overrides supplied with a single
scan, layered on top of everything below it — including a preset's knob bundle
(layer 6a). So `apply_check_overrides` runs AFTER `scan_presets.apply_runtime`
(6b > 6a). Each override targets one check by name and assigns the set fields onto
that already-resolved instance, exactly like `apply_runtime` does for presets.

Ephemeral by construction: it mutates the per-scan instances and touches nothing
on disk. The persistent sibling — writing a value into a check's `config.yaml`
(layer 3) — is the `PUT /api/v1/checks/{name}/config` "save as default" endpoint.

    An override for a check that isn't in `checks` (deselected, disabled, or an
    unknown name) is silently skipped — there is no instance to scalpel. An
