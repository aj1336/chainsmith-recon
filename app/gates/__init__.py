Gates — deterministic allow/block authorities at the scan chokepoint.

A gate answers "may this proceed?" — scope, scan-window, and forbidden-technique
enforcement — and is the single point where a scan is allowed or blocked
([[project_guardian_gating]]). Gates decide (return allow/block + reason); they
never call an LLM and never merely recommend (that's an advisor).

The `Guardian` is re-exported here so the historical import surface resolves to
the folder-shape component (Phase 56 §3.3, 56.12).
