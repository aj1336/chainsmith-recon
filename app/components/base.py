"""
app/components/base.py - Minimal BaseComponent (Phase 56 §6).

`BaseComponent` is the thin common ancestor of all four component types
(check/agent/advisor/gate). It holds only what the loader touches uniformly:
identity (`id`/`name`/`component_type`) and the `from_config()` construction
contract.

It is deliberately minimal. The rich per-type bases
(`BaseCheck`/`BaseAgent`/`BaseAdvisor`/`BaseGate`) attach as their phases land
(56.10-56.12), so the abstraction grows from real implementations rather than
being guessed up front. `BaseCheck` (app/checks/base.py) is its first subclass.

Construction is no-arg: `from_config()` builds the instance via `cls()` — exactly
how `get_real_checks()` instantiates checks today — then applies the resolved
load-time config baseline (§5.1 layers 1-5) by attribute assignment. An
auto-discovered component must therefore be no-arg constructible;
`verify_contracts()` AST-asserts this on every `entry` class (§8.6).
