"""
app/scan_session.py - Per-Scan Session State

Introduced in Phase A of the concurrent-scans overhaul. A ScanSession owns
the fields that today live on the AppState singleton but are logically
per-scan: status/phase, progress counters, runner reference, guardian,
cooperative pause/stop controls, and post-scan phase statuses.

Phase A: ScanSession exists alongside AppState. run_scan() creates one per
scan, registers it in ScanRegistry, and mirrors scalar writes into it.
Mutable containers (check_statuses, skip_reasons, pause_event, runner,
guardian) are held by reference so writes through `state` show up on the
session without explicit mirroring. Routes still read from `state`.

Phase B will flip reads to the registry and remove the per-scan fields
from AppState entirely.
