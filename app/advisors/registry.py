"""app/advisors/registry.py - Advisor discovery + config accessor (Phase 56 §6, 56.11).

Advisors are deterministic and caller-constructed (see `app/advisors/base.py`),
so this is NOT a factory like `app/agents/registry.py` — there is no `.create()`.
Discovery returns *specs* (contract + resolved config + entry class) purely so
call sites can answer two questions before they build the advisor themselves:

    reg = get_advisor_registry()
    cfg = reg.config("scan_analysis")        # resolved config.yaml (enabled + parameters)
    cls = reg.entry_cls("scan_analysis")     # the advisor class to construct

It reuses the shared `verify_contracts()` gate and the loader's path helpers, so
advisor folders are held to the same identity/placement invariants as checks and
agents.

Unlike the agent registry, **disabled advisors are still discovered** (not
skipped). `enabled` is data the introspection routes report and the scan path
gates on per-call — not a visibility switch — so e.g. the default-disabled
`scan_analysis` must remain readable via `reg.config("scan_analysis").enabled`.
