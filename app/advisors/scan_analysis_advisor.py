"""
app/advisors/scan_analysis_advisor.py - Post-Scan Analysis Advisor (Phase 20, renamed Phase 41)

Optional, rule-based advisor that analyzes completed scan results and
recommends follow-up actions. Disabled by default. Never runs checks —
only recommends.

Renamed from ScanAdvisor → ScanAnalysisAdvisor in Phase 41 to clarify
its post-scan role and make room for ScanPlannerAdvisor (pre-scan).

Phase 1: Post-scan analysis only.
- Gap analysis: checks that could have run with better inputs
- Partial results: checks that errored or timed out
- Follow-up suggestions: deeper checks based on what was observed
- Coverage cross-reference: suites with zero or low coverage

Usage:
    from app.advisors.scan_analysis_advisor import ScanAnalysisAdvisor

    advisor = ScanAnalysisAdvisor(launcher, all_checks)
    recommendations = advisor.analyze()
