"""
app/agents/base.py - BaseAgent (Phase 56 §6, sub-phase 56.10).

The per-type base for `agent` components, attaching to the minimal
`BaseComponent` (identity + construction contract).

Agents diverge from checks in *construction*. A check is a no-arg startup
singleton built by `discover_components` via `cls()` + attribute assignment. An
agent needs a runtime `LLMClient` and an optional **per-session**
`event_callback`, and is built **per request/session** — so a shared startup
singleton would cross-wire callbacks between concurrent sessions.

So agents are discovered as *specs* (`app/agents/registry.py`) and constructed
on demand through `from_spec()`, which injects the runtime deps and applies the
load-time config baseline. The check loader's no-arg `from_config()` is not used
for agents; calling it raises (inherited from `BaseComponent`).
